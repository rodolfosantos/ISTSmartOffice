## Motivation behind the Codebase library
The fundamental idea of the Codebase library is to avoid replicating basic utility functionality over and over again. 

In practice, programmers often need to replicate the code of utility classes and, moreover, have a tendency to regard this code as of lesser importance. An obvious consequence is that these classes don't get as thoroughly tested as they often should, often compromising code quality. Therefore, the underlying idea is to put here functionality that are commonly used in the code to avoid that each project/developer to implement its own version and have it throughly tested. 

Technologies used:

* OSGI
* REST

## Design and development of the SMARTCAMPUS API
* All the code undergoes strict static checking and most of it is unit tested for maximum reliability.

* SMARTCAMPUS API can be used as an OSGi bundle.
